    print("\n📁 FILE CHANGES:")
    print("✅ biot_trainer_2d.py - MAIN FILE (corrected)")
    print("✅ biot_trainer_2d copy.py - BACKUP (restored to original)")
    print("✅ colab_test_corrected.py - TEST SCRIPT (no path issues)")
    
    print("\n🔧 EXACT SOLUTION FIX:")
    print("❌ OLD: Step function pressure, simple linear displacement")
    print("   - p = step function (discontinuous)")
    print("   - u_x = linear, u_y = 0")
    print("   - Didn't satisfy traction-free boundary conditions")
    
    print("✅ NEW: Smooth polynomial solution")
    print("   - p = 1-x (linear, satisfies ∂p/∂y=0)")
    print("   - u_x = polynomial zero at x=0")
    print("   - u_y = polynomial zero at x=0, y=0")
    print("   - Designed to satisfy all boundary conditions")
    
    print("\n⚙️ CONFIGURATION OPTIMIZATIONS:")
    print("❌ OLD: Problematic setup")
    print("   - 4×3 = 12 subdomains (too many)")
    print("   - (100,100) vs (25,25,25,25) = 10k:100 sampling imbalance")
    print("   - Small subdomain overlap")
    
    print("✅ NEW: Optimized setup")
    print("   - 3×3 = 9 subdomains (reduced)")
    print("   - (50,50) vs (50,50,50,50) = 2.5k:200 balanced sampling")
    print("   - Larger subdomain overlap (0.6)")
    print("   - Higher BC weight (5.0 instead of 1.0)")
    
    print("\n🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:")
    print("The model was trying to learn an IMPOSSIBLE TARGET!")
    print("- Exact solution didn't satisfy the boundary conditions")
    print("- Model had no achievable goal → no learning occurred")
    print("- Fix: Provide consistent exact solution")
    
    print("\n🧪 TESTING:")
    print("Run colab_test_corrected.py in Google Colab to verify:")
    print("1. Exact solution satisfies boundary conditions")
    print("2. Model can learn the corrected target")
    print("3. No file path issues")
    
    print("\n📈 EXPECTED RESULTS:")
    print("✅ Model should now learn physics correctly")
    print("✅ Training loss should decrease consistently")
    print("✅ Predictions should match exact solution")
    print("✅ Visualizations should show realistic physics")
