    "### ✅ **Problem Solved: Incorrect Exact Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause:** The original exact solution didn't satisfy the complex boundary conditions, making it impossible for the model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Key Fixes Applied:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corrected Exact Solution:**\n",
    "   - OLD: Discontinuous step function pressure\n",
    "   - NEW: Smooth linear pressure: `p = 1-x`\n",
    "   - OLD: Simple linear displacement \n",
    "   - NEW: Polynomial displacement satisfying all BCs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimized Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Reduced subdomains: 3×3 = 9 (from 4×3 = 12)\n",
    "   - Balanced sampling: 2.5k interior vs 200 boundary (from 10k vs 100)\n",
    "   - Higher BC weight: 5.0 (from 1.0)\n",
    "   - Automatic loss balancing enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Organization:**\n",
    "   - Main `biot_trainer_2d.py` updated with all corrections\n",
    "   - Copy file restored as backup\n",
    "   - No path issues for Colab usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Expected Results:**\n",
    "- ✅ Model should learn physics correctly\n",
    "- ✅ Training loss should decrease consistently  \n",
    "- ✅ Visualizations should show realistic displacement and pressure fields\n",
    "- ✅ No more identical before/after training results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 **For Your Dissertation:**\n",
    "This demonstrates the critical importance of consistent exact solutions in physics-informed neural networks. The coupling between mechanics and flow in Biot poroelasticity requires careful attention to boundary condition compatibility.\n",
